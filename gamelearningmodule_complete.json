In a democratic system, citizens have the right to participate in decision-making processes, either directly or through elected representatives.\n\nThe word \"democracy\" comes from the Greek words \"demos\" (people) and \"kratos\" (power or rule), literally meaning \"rule by the people.\" This fundamental principle ensures that government serves the interests of its citizens rather than a small elite group.",

        "historical_context": "The concept of democracy has ancient roots, with early examples in ancient Greece around 500 BCE. The city-state of Athens practiced direct democracy where citizens could directly participate in decision-making.\n\nModern democracy evolved through centuries of struggle, with key milestones including the Magna Carta (1215), the American Revolution (1776), and the French Revolution (1789).
